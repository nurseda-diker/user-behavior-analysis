# User Behavior Analysis
This project is designed to understand and apply basic statistics concepts. Hypothesis testing, correlation and regression analyzes were conducted on a data set based on the behavior of mobile device usage on users.

## Techniques and Tools Used
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - pandas, numpy: Data manipulation
  - matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization
  - scipy.stats: Probability and hypothesis testing
  - scikit-learn: Regression analysis
- **Statistical Methods**:
  - Hypothesis tests (T-test, Z-test, Kruskal-Wallis, Anova, Mann-Whitney U)
  - Correlation analysis 
  - Linear and multiple regression

## About Dataset
<b>Source</b> <br> 
The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset). <br> 
**Features** <br>
It includes features such as Device Model, Operating System, App Usage Time , Screen On Time , Battery Drain , Number of Apps Installed, Data Usage, Age , Gender, User Behavior Class.


## Project Phases
#### 1. Data Discovery and Visualization
- Examining the data set and missing/data cleaning procedures
#### 2.Hypothesis Tests
- Examining whether there is a statistically significant difference between features through different hypothesis tests
#### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Visualizing the relationship between variables with a correlation matrix
- Making inferences by focusing on meaningful relationships
#### 4. Regression Analysis
- Prediction of a dependent variable with simple linear regression
- Effect of multiple independent variables with multiple regression model

## Results
As a result of the correlation and regression analyses, it was determined that there was a strong correlation between some variables. In addition, the performance of the model trained by regression analysis was evaluated with R² and MSE values ​​and it was seen that the model had a high predictive power.
